I recently finished an EPSRC funded Research Fellow post as part of the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/) at the University of St Andrews.

My research is focused on fractal geometry and dynamical systems, and I'm also interested in hyperbolic geometry.

My PhD was supervised by [Professor Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and [Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/), and was funded by the University of St Andrews.
