I recently finished an EPSRC funded Research Fellow post as part of the [analysis research group](https://maths-analysis.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/) at the University of St Andrews, and am looking to transition into a role in data science/analysis and machine learning. Proficiency demonstrated through a [stock price prediction app](https://github.com/liam-stuart/stock-prediction-app) published on GitHub.

My research was focused on fractal geometry and dynamical systems, and I'm also interested in hyperbolic geometry.

My PhD was supervised by [Professor Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/) and [Professor Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/), and was funded by the University of St Andrews.
